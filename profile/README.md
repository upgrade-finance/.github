# UPGRADE – The Onchain NASDAQ for Private Innovation Markets

> **TL;DR:**  
> UPGRADE is building the **onchain NASDAQ for private innovation markets**.  
> Starting with **biotech**, we are lowering investment barriers, reducing dilution, and enabling earlier liquidity by **tokenizing individual drug programs** within biotech companies.  
> What NASDAQ did for paper-based equity trading, **UPGRADE** will do for today's fragmented innovation markets.

## Vision

UPGRADE brings **capital market infrastructure onchain**, beginning with the **biotech sector**. By tokenizing drug programs, we make traditionally illiquid, high-barrier biotech investments accessible, fractional, and liquid. Our platform enables:

- **Fair onchain fundraising** via **compliant launchpad auctions**  
- **KYC-gated transferability** using **ERC-3643 (T-REX)**  
- **Automatic liquidity provisioning** and **protocol-owned liquidity** through our custom DEX  
- A future **DeFi layer** for lending, borrowing, and ETF-style biotech baskets  

UPGRADE bridges **DeSci**, **DeFi**, and **TradFi**, creating a unified, regulated market for private innovation assets.

## Team

Our team combines **DeSci and DeFi leadership** with deep **Wall Street** and **biotech investment banking** expertise.

- Founders and contributors from **SEI / Sapien Capital**, **VitaDAO**, **karpatkey**  
- Ex-Goldman Sachs, **ex-Wall Street biotech IB** professionals  
- TradFi and biotech founders from **Trade.com** and **Jade Cardiometabolic**

Together, we are building the financial rails for the next generation of innovation markets.

## Architecture Overview

The UPGRADE protocol is composed of:

- **Launchpad** – Compliant tokenized fundraising via fair batch auctions  
- **Vault** – Protocol-owned liquidity, milestone fund releases, and buyback logic  
- **Token** – ERC-3643 (T-REX) compliant token standard with identity gating  
- **DEX (UpDEX)** – Custom AMM seeded directly from Launchpad proceeds  
- **Liquidity Market (Future)** – Aave-style borrowing and lending for biotech tokens  

Each fundraising event deploys a full set of composable contracts from the **Factory**, integrating compliance, tokenomics, and liquidity management at protocol level.
